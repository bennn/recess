;; writing this example made me think about wanting multiple queries in a system
;; or some kind of compound queries

(define-system cross-my-ocean
  #:in [seconds clock/e]
  #:pre y (sleep 1)
  #:query e (lookup Player)
  #:map mapval (displayln (get e 'Guess)) (set! e (random OCEAN) 'Guess) e
  #:out [shark-guesses/e (map (Î» (e) (get e 'Guess)) (filter Shark? mapval))])

(define-system shark-bite
  #:in [seconds clock/e]
  #:in [on-cross cross-my-ocean]
  #:in [sharks shark-guesses/e]
  #:query e (lookup Fish)
  #:map _
  (displayln e)
  (displayln "sharks") (displayln sharks)
  (when (member (get e 'Guess) sharks) (- (+ e Seaweed) Fish Player)))

;; really these do the same thing except just in two different phases
(define-system seaweed-attack

  #:query e (lookup Fish)
