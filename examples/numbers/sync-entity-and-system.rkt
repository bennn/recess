;; the idea behind this system is to create a pattern using a numeric entity
;; we add increasing even numbers to get the next number
;; for example: 
;; 0,+2 2,+4 6,+6 12,+8 20,+10 30,+12 42, â€¦
;; we can model the system's state as the increasing even number
;; and the entity is the base number

  ;; there is a binding called x in our state
  ;; initially it has the value of 5
  #:state [x 2]
  ;; query for all entities that have the component/archetype: Count
  ;; we know there will only be one so bind it to e
  #:query e (Count)
  ;; this system is enabled as long as the clock's value is less
  ;; than 15 seconds

  ;; every iteration increment e by 1 and print it
